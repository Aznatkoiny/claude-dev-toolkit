Check if the file that was just written or edited is a plugin component file (SKILL.md, plugin.json, hooks.json, agent .md, command .md, or output-style .md).\n\nIf it IS a plugin component, check for these convention violations:\n1. SKILL.md: Must have 'name' and 'description' in YAML frontmatter\n2. plugin.json: Must have 'name', 'version', and 'description' fields. Must be in .claude-plugin/ directory\n3. hooks.json: Must use ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} for script paths (not absolute paths)\n4. Agent .md: Must have 'name' and 'description' (with example blocks) in frontmatter\n5. Command .md: Must have 'description' in frontmatter\n6. No plugin components should be inside .claude-plugin/ directory (only manifests go there)\n\nIf the file is NOT a plugin component, or if it passes all checks, respond with just: APPROVE\n\nIf it fails a check, respond with a brief, actionable message starting with 'Convention note:' followed by what needs fixing. Keep it to 1-2 sentences."
